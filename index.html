        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Athena, a senior from the BSE department. I applied for this job so I could gain more coding experience. Having taken courses in my department, I know some very basic C, C++, Python, and R, but I like HTML and CSS more, as they are the first coding languages I learned. I learned using Codecademy, back in 2015, so that I could make websites! </p>

    <section id="skills">
        <h2>My Skills</h2>
        <p>A list of some skills I have learned, and things I'm good at.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Languages</li>
                <p>As a trilingual person, I know a good number of languages, the three being English, Chinese, and Japanese. This makes communicating a lot easier. I got 990 on the recent TOEIC exam, and I'm equivalent of N2, on the J-TEST. </p>
            
            <li>Creation</li>
                <p>I'm quite good with my hands. In my free time, I do a bit of drawing (digital illustration using Procreate). I've recently started embroidering as well. I also have a keen eye for aesthetics as I used to take art and graphics design in highschool.</p>
            
            <li>Coding Basics</li>
                <p>While I have a long way to go, I am able to use the very basics of code. This includes a bit of python, C, and R. I'm more confident in HTML and CSS, though. I hope to learn more in this experience. I have VS Code downloaded on my mac. I know some basic terminal command lines.</p>
        
            <li>Using Resources</li>
                <p>We are not omniscient. It is impossible for us to know everything. Admittedly, I did use ChatGPT and w3schools to discover the effects I wanted to use in my website. Once I understood how the code worked, I rewrote the code into the HTML and CSS files. I had a lot of fun playing around with the CSS file and making aesthetic choices.

        <div class="image-container">
        <ul>
            <li>Gems</li>
                <p>Recently, i've been trying to gain some knowledge on gemstones. I got into this, because of a Japanese Light Novel series called 'The Case Files of Jeweler Richard'. I've attached the link below!</p>

            <li>Fiction</li>
                <p>I like reading novels, and also graphic novels. I want to write my own novel, at some point. Here are some that I recommend.</p>

            <li>Delicious Food</li>
                <p>Being able to eat different foods is life's true contentment. I like spicy foods in particular. And also, rice. </p>
